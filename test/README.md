### ```attention!```

The tests developed here are rather sensitive to the initial parameters provided for STORM 3 (by default), that is, files [parameters.py](../parameters.py) and [ProbabilityDensityFunctions_TWO.csv](../model_input/ProbabilityDensityFunctions_TWO.csv) (or [ProbabilityDensityFunctions_ONE-pmf.csv](../model_input/ProbabilityDensityFunctions_ONE-pmf.csv)), from which a copy is provided in this folder (i.e., *copy_parameters.py* and *copy_ProbabilityDensityFunctions_TWO.csv*).\
Therefore, if for some reason tests initially start failing, please replace STORM 3 default files/parameters (having made a security copy first) by the ones provided in this directory.
If the problem persists... then call for help.
